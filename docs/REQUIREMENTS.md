## Domain Context
In today’s academic environment, students frequently need to print a large number of documents such as: lecture notes, project reports and lecture books. In Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, many students rely on photocopy stores located outside the campus to print their materials. This reliance has some challenges: the first one involves traveling to and from the stores, then waiting for their turn since the store also serves other customers than the student. This process can be time consuming especially for students who have tight schedules.  Additionally, the stores use third-party apps like Zalo to receive files from the customer, which will then be downloaded to the store’s computers. Since the computers are freely accessible to the customer, this obviously raises some concern about sensitive documents. These issues show the necessity of a specialized printing service for the students, a  Student Smart Printing Service (HCMUT_SSPS) that can provide convenience by offering web-based and mobile app services, and security by utilizing Student’s ID authentication.
