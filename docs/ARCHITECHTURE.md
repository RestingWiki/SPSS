## Layered architecture

### Presentation Strategy
- The Presentation Layer is divided into two interfaces: Student Interface and SPSO Interface.
  - Both user types access the system through the pre-existing HCMUT Single Sign-On (SSO), ensuring secure authentication.
  
- Student Interface:
  - Upon logging in, students are directed to a personalized Home Page:
    - Displays current page balance.
    - Shows recent print activities.
    - Allows students to buy more paper.
  - Features:
    - **File Upload**: 
      - Push documents to the accountâ€™s document repository.
      - Detached from the Print Document feature to avoid redundant uploads.
    - **View Printer**: 
      - Provides information about printer locations and statuses on campus.
    - **Print Documents**: 
      - Allows students to select printers, ideally the nearest one.
      - Configure print options (e.g., paper size, single/double-sided, number of copies).
      - Monitor printing progress.

- SPSO Interface:
  - Upon logging in, SPSOs are directed to a Dashboard:
    - Provides an overview of system information:
      - Printer usage.
      - Monthly print job report of the SPSS.
    - Service Controls:
      - Add new printers from a list of unused printers.
      - Enable/Disable printers.
      - Define allowable file types for student uploads.
      - Manage various system configurations.
