## Description
HCMUT_SSPS (Student Smart Printing Service) is a convenient, smart printing solution for students at HCMUT.

- **Printer Network**: Multiple printers located in different buildings within the campus, each printer is identified by ID, brand, model, and location details (campus, building, room).

- **Easy Document Printing**: Students can upload files, choose a printer, and customize printing options (paper size, specific pages, single/double-sided, number of copies, etc.). Supported file types are managed by the Student Printing Service Officer (SPSO).

- **Printing Logs**: Tracks all printing activities.

- **Student Page Balance**: 
  - Each students receive a default number of A4 pages each semester.
  - Extra pages can be purchased using the "Buy Printing Pages" feature, with payment handled by the pre-existing BKPay system.


- **Features for SPSO**:
  - Manage printers (add, enable, disable).
  - Configure system settings (default page, allowed file types, configure dates for default page  allocation).
  - Generate monthly reports for the whole system.

- **Access Control**: All users are authenticated through the HCMUT_SSO service.

The system is accessible via both a web-based app and a mobile app, ensuring ease of use for students and administrators alike.
